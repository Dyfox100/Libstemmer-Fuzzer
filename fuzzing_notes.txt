Notes about Fuzzing Libstemmer:
1. Generating large amounts of random data to input into some app to cause a crash.
2. Try to determine what values could be potentially dangerous to app (ex. 0 or negative values for something that should be a positive number, etc...)
  a. libstemmer is designed to stem UTF-8 strings. Maybe non-UTF-8 chars, valid strings with a non-valid char in the ending (ex. "play_ng" where _ is non-utf8).
  b. If out of memory exception occurs, libstemmer will return null. Maybe extremely large strings to try and cause crash.
  c. Mongo uses libstemmer for full text search, so will need to eventually figure out what values mongo will allow into text fields,
     but entering bad data than running a full text search could trigger a crash.
3. There's examples of how to call libstemmer in source folder of libstemmer in mongo repo, replicate this call in python with Ctypes.
